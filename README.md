This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using catch-all routes (`/*`) in React Router DOM v6.  The problem arises when the catch-all route unintentionally overrides other defined routes, leading to unexpected navigation behavior. The solution provided addresses this by carefully ordering the routes and ensuring that the catch-all route is placed last to handle only routes not explicitly defined.
